# Deep Learning Stack of blogs

I am doing a series of blogs that i learnt thorught my journey. I am stacking up things and experimetns i learnt in my way. I am more of a vision guy than LLM, so the blogs might be biased to vision. 


1. auto deep learnig - to automate the deep learning model trianing and learn when they fail
2. better dl models - now how to recover the models on the failed cases
3. 3d vision - can we do something in data generation or restoration in 3d directly
4. 2d vision - can we do something in data generation or restoration in 2d directly
5. multimodal - can we do something by bringing in more modalities
